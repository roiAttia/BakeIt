# BakeIt
Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree Program Project.

## About this Project
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

## Goals for this Project
- Implement MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
- Handle error cases in Android.
- Add a widget.
- Leverage third-party libraries in the app.
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
- Localize the app for another language.
